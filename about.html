<h1>About NannyTracker</h1>

<h2>About the App</h2>
<p>
NannyTracker helps nannies and families stay organized and improve communication around childcare responsibilities. 
The app allows users to track schedules, log hours worked, manage daily tasks, record mileage, and estimate compensation based on user-entered information. 
By keeping all important details in one central location, NannyTracker simplifies coordination and reduces misunderstandings, helping caregivers and families stay aligned.
</p>

<p>
The app is designed to be an easy-to-use organizational and record-keeping tool. It does not provide legal, payroll, tax, or employment services. Users are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of information entered and compliance with applicable childcare and employment laws. By providing clear, accurate tracking, NannyTracker helps parents and caregivers make informed decisions and maintain transparency.
